Submit your work on your GiT repository as usual. Only the work on your repository
will be graded.
Once your have completed your defences, Deepthought (the “moulinette”) will grade
your work. Your final grade will be calculated taking into account your peer-correction
grades and Deepthought’s grade.
Deepthought will grade your assignments in the order of the subject : Part 1, Part 2
and Bonus. One error in one of the sections will automatically stop the grading.
Good luck to you and don’t forget your author file !
